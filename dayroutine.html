  <div class="whiteboard" id="whiteboard">
    <div class="scene">🕘 9:00 AM – I reach office and wait for her to come.</div>
    <div class="scene">🚪 I keep looking at the door, hoping she'll arrive soon.</div>
    <div class="scene">😄 She teases me saying, "I'm not coming today" – and I fall for it every time.</div>
    <div class="scene">😔 My mood drops without her. It's hard to stay without her presence.</div>
    <div class="scene">😊 Then she arrives, and I pretend not to notice – but inside, I'm full of joy.</div>
    <div class="scene">🗨️ I wait for her to talk to me. Sometimes we talk for seconds, sometimes minutes.</div>
    <div class="scene">👋 I often walk to her seat just to say hi or hello for a moment.</div>
    <div class="scene">🕌 We wait for Dhuhr prayer time – a chance to talk more.</div>
    <div class="scene">🍱 At lunch, I wait for her call. She knows, and every time she calls, it makes me smile.</div>
    <div class="scene">😄 We sometimes gossip after lunch – light moments I cherish.</div>
    <div class="scene">🤝 I hold her hand when we talk. That’s my favorite thing.</div>
    <div class="scene">👀 Sometimes I just look at her in silence from behind my seat. It brings me peace.</div>
    <div class="scene">🚶‍♂️ On leaving, I always wait until she finishes so we can go together.</div>
    <div class="scene">🕒 At 3:00 PM, I send my driver a message to delay pickup till 6:40 – just to leave with her.</div>
    <div class="scene">👋 We say goodbye with a handshake. I always remind her if she forgets – it's special to me.</div>
    <div class="scene">🏡 After reaching home, we message each other.</div>
    <div class="scene">📞 In the evening, we talk on the phone. Sometimes it ends... sometimes it doesn't.</div>
